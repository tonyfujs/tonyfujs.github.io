title: R you ready to ggplot?
---

Ggplot2 is an amazing tool for static data visualization, but one might not realize how powerful it is until getting a full grasp of its underlying logic: The Grammar of Graphics(gg!).

Using ggplot2 without understanding the grammar of graphics is possible, but it’s a bit like going to a 3D movie without your 3D glasses…don’t expect to get the full experience.

If you want to get the full ggplot2 experience, check these slides (use Chrome):

1. [Intro to ggplot2](http://tonyfujs.github.io/ggplot_post/00_gg_intro/#/)

2. [Understanding the Grammar of Graphics](http://tonyfujs.github.io/ggplot_post/01_gg_theory/#/) (As implemented in R/ggplot2)

3. Play with code: [Basic plots](http://tonyfujs.github.io/ggplot_post/02_gg_basic/#/)

4. Play with code: [Advanced plots](http://tonyfujs.github.io/ggplot_post/03_gg_advanced/#/)      


Code, data, and handsout from the workshop can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/tonyfujs/ggplot_workshop/archive/master.zip)     


And if you want to get a deeper understanding of ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics, nothing beats the originals:

* [Hadley Wickam’s book](http://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1402609663&sr=1-1&keywords=hadley+wickham) and the [ggplot2 webpage](http://ggplot2.org/)

* [Leland Wilkinson’s book](http://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448)
